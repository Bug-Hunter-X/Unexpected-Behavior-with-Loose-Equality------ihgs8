# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (`==`).  Loose equality can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values of different types.  The bug is explained in detail below, along with the solution.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function is intended to perform a calculation based on input values `a` and `b`. However, the conditional statement uses loose equality (`==`) to check for `null` values. This can cause incorrect results when unexpected values (like 0 or "") are passed, which are considered falsy values and can lead to unexpected outcomes.

## Bug Solution

The solution is to replace loose equality (`==`) with strict equality (`===`) to ensure that the conditional statement correctly identifies only `null` values.
